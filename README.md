Overview of the Project
project:Simple Calculator

Objective
The objective of creating a simple calculator in Python is to develop a program that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project serves several purposes:

1. Learning Basic Programming Concepts
2. Understanding Arithmetic Operations 
3. Error Handling 
4. Building User Interfaces
5. Problem Solving and Logic Building

Key Activities
  The key activities of a simple calculator program in Python involve implementing the steps necessary to perform basic arithmetic operations. These activities can be broken down into the following:

1. User Input
2. :
   - Accept input from the user for the numbers and the operation they want to perform (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.).
   - Validate user inputs to ensure they are valid numbers and operations.

3. Operation Selection:
   - Present the user with options for available operations (e.g., +, -, *, /).
   - Capture the user's choice of operation and validate it to ensure it is among the available options.

4. Perform Calculations:
   - Based on the user's selection, perform the corresponding arithmetic operation on the input values.
   - Implement the logic for each operation, such as:
     - Addition (+)
     - Subtraction (-)
     - Multiplication (*)
     - Division (/)
   - Handle any edge cases, such as division by zero.

5. Error Handling:
   - Manage potential errors gracefully, such as:
     - Division by zero.
     - Invalid operation selection.
     - Non-numeric inputs.
   - Provide clear error messages to guide the user.

6. Display Results:
   - Output the result of the calculation back to the user in a readable format.
   - Allow the user to see the outcome of their input operation.
